PROJECT SETUP:
- CMake build system
- Build directories: build/debug, build/release (assume these exist, don't try to create them)
- Testing: -DBUILD_TESTING=ON flag
- Run tests: ./bin/arbtrie-tests, filter with ./bin/arbtrie-tests "[tag]"
- Catch2 testing framework
- NO --success flag (produces too much output)
- C++20 standard is used throughout the project

CODE STYLE:
- See style_prompt.txt for detailed code style guidelines
- No braces {} for one-line conditionals and loops
- Use angle brackets <> for project includes (#include <arbtrie/header.hpp>)
- Comments: align * with first * in /** (not indented)
- Use ARBTRIE_WARN("message: ", variable, ...) for critical errors instead of std::cerr/std::cout

AGENT:
- Always use full paths with rm commands
- For git operations, refer to git_prompt.txt
- Check all code edits against style_prompt.txt before submitting

WORKFLOW:
- "propose" = describe changes only, no code edits
- Propose new project standards when common errors identified
