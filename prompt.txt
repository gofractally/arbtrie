PROJECT SETUP:
- CMake build system
- Build directories: build/debug, build/release
- Testing: -DBUILD_TESTING=ON flag
- Run tests: ./bin/arbtrie-tests, filter with ./bin/arbtrie-tests "[tag]"
- Catch2 testing framework
- NO --success flag (produces too much output)

CODE STYLE:
- No braces {} for one-line conditionals and loops
- Use angle brackets <> for project includes (#include <arbtrie/header.hpp>)

AGENT:
- Always use full paths with rm commands

WORKFLOW:
- "propose" = describe changes only, no code edits
- Update both prompt.txt and .cursor file when standards change
- Propose new project standards when common errors identified
