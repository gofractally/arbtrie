# If you're using VSCode

The default files included in the .vscode directory end in ".sample". To use them, duplicate them inside the .vscode directory, and rename the duplicates to remove the trailing ".sample" from the filename. Only the sample files should be checked into source control, allowing you to customize the real files locally to meet your personal development needs.

The four default files are:
1. c_cpp_properties.json: Provides better intellisense
2. psibase.code-snippets: Shortcuts for common psibase activities
3. settings.json: Default formatter settings
4. tasks.json: Buttons in the blue taskbar at the bottom of the VSCode UI to aid in building/testing your services

## Getting build/test UI buttons

Ensure `actboy168.tasks` extension is installed, and then define the relevant build tasks in tasks.json. This extension allows tasks defined in tasks.json to be bound to buttons on the blue taskbar at the bottom of the VSCode IDE.

## Getting Intellisense

To get c++ intellisense to work properly, you will need to set the compileCommands field in the c_cpp_properties.json. The compile_commands.json file will be automatically generated by cmake. This means that intellisense will only start working *after* your first build in this repo has completed.
